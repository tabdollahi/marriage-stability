This is a command-line program for finding solutions to the stable marriage problem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem

The stable marriage problem has been stated as follows:

Given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. When there are no such pairs of people, the set of marriages is deemed stable.

The algorithm implemented is deterministic and optimal for the initiator of the proposals. This stable, suitor-optimal solution may or may not be optimal for the reviewer of the proposals.

The goal of this project is to provide a statistical analysis comparing the overall satisifaction of initiators and reviewers in this model.
